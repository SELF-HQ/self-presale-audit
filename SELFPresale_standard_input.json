This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n * to enforce additional security measures for this role.\n */\nabstract contract AccessControl is Context, IAccessControl, ERC165 {\n    struct RoleData {\n        mapping(address => bool) members;\n        bytes32 adminRole;\n    }\n\n    mapping(bytes32 => RoleData) private _roles;\n\n    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.

security\n * @dev Supports multiple rounds with different prices, bonuses, and TGE unlocks\n * @dev IMPORTANT: BSC USDC uses 18 decimals (not 6 like Ethereum USDC)\n * \n * Security Features:\n * - Role-based access control (RBAC) with multiple roles\n * - Timelock delays (2-7 days) on critical admin functions\n * - Circuit breaker: $500k daily withdrawal limit\n * - Refund mechanism if soft cap ($500k) not reached\n * - Unclaimed refund recovery after 30-day window\n * - ReentrancyGuard on all external state-changing functions\n * - Pausable for emergency stops\n * - SafeERC20 for all token transfers\n * - Flash loan protection (block cooldown)\n * - Whale protection (max 10% of round per tx)\n * - Rate limiting ($100k/hour per wallet)\n * - Precision math with rounding in favor of users\n * - Timestamp validation on round initialization\n * - Maximum TGE delay to prevent indefinite fund locking\n * \n * Roles:\n * - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: Super admin (multi-sig recommended)\n * - PAUSER_ROLE: Can pause/unpause contract\n * - ROUND_MANAGER_ROLE: Can manage round lifecycle\n * - TREASURY_ROLE: Can withdraw funds with timelock + circuit breaker\n * - TGE_ENABLER_ROLE: Can enable TGE with timelock\n * \n * Architecture:\n * - 5 sequential rounds with progressive pricing\n * - Soft cap: $500k (refunds enabled if not reached)\n * - Hard cap: $2.5M\n * - TGE unlock: 30-50% immediate + bonus\n * - Vesting: 10-month linear for remaining tokens\n * \n * @custom:security-contact security@self.app\n * @custom:audit-status Certik Audit - Enhanced Version\n */\ncontract
